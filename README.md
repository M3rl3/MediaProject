# Media Fundamentals Project

Project repository for GDP - 2022. (Media Fundamentals - INFO-6046) 

<p>This application is designed using C++ and FMOD Studio api, while the GUI is made using imgui and opengl.

<br/>Upon initial launch of the application, you will be prompted to select the compression on the sound files that you would like to play. This option will only be accessible once per run.
<br/>This application also features a game where you guess the genre of the song that is playing. Each correct option you select will play a sound effect to indicate so and will also increment your score by one. Your goal is to guess all answers correctly. 
<br/>Also, channel specific DSP effects can be added at any point to playing sounds by clicking the button below its respective channel name. Clicking any DSP effect button again, naturally will remove the specific effect that was added.
<br/> Note: the pause button only works on the last sound that was played. To stop all sound effects that are currently playing, use the spacebar or the provided button that offers the same functionality.
